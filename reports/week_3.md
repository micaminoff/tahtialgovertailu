#### Time spent - 14h

## Worklog
#### 31.1
* Worked on translating graph-files to my own structure
* Studied datastructures and A\*
* Made a plan for rewriting core logic

#### 1.2
* Made robust translation of graphs from movingai
* Reworked Dijkstra and datastructures

#### 2.2
* Reworked EVERYTHING
* Wrote A\*, tested

## Progress/Future

I realized my previous approach was far too specific for only Dijkstra and only a certain type of graph which wasn't too intersting.
Thus I had to redo everything, which led to an even more specific graph representation, but at least the graphs are interesting.

I'll still need to implement D\*.
I've had major trouble with designing my program and realize I should have focussed more on that from the start.
Now my testing is fairly lackluster.

### Brief Intro
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the most widely used
path-finding algorithms; **Dijkstra**, **A\***, and IDA\* as well as the data
structures needed to implement them. This project will be implemented in
**Java using Gradle and JUnit**.

A secondary purpose is to analyze and compare both time- and space-complexity
for various inputs.

I chose this problem because path-finding is a very common problem, and I wanted
to see how the more advanced algorithms work, what their features and drawbacks
are, and how they compare to each other given various inputs. **I hope to
uncover important information regarding how much performance one is willing to
give up to save on memory and vice versa.**
